## Omniflix Launchpad Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for the Omniflix Launchpad platform. These contracts are responsible for launching an NFT collection.

## Factories

Launchpad utilizes a singleton structure for each collection that is released through this launchpad. The purpose of the factories is to create an instance of minters and whitelist contracts, while also configuring the creation price and payment collection.
